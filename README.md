# Go Lang
## Prepare your Mind
**Somewhere Along the Line**
- We became impressed with sheer volume 
- We strived to create large abstractions in our code base
- We forgot that the hardware is the platform
- We lost the understanding that every decision comes with a cost

**These Days Are Gone**
-  We can throw more hardware at the problem
-  We can throw more developers at the problem

**Aspire To**
- Be a champion for quality efficiency and simplicity
- Have a point of view
- Value introspection and self review

**Open Your Mind**
- Technology changes fast but people change slowly
- Easy to adopt technology but hard to adopt new ways of thinking
